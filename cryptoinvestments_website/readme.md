Crypto-Investments Website
=========

A Website for Crypto-Investments Made with Flask and Python

Installation
------------
If you are using Python 3, then cd into the app folder and then create a virtual environment with the following command:

`$ python -m venv flask`

If you are using any other version of Python older than 3.4, then you need to download and install virtualenv.py before you can create a virtual environment. If you are on Mac OS X, then you can install it with the following command:

`$ sudo easy_install virtualenv`

On Linux you likely have a package for your distribution. For example, if you use Ubuntu:

`$ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv`

To install modules on the virtual envirovment you must use the python installed within the virtual environemnt:
`$ flask/bin/pip install <module_name>`

Running
--------
To run the application in the development web server just execute run.py with the Python interpreter from the flask virtual environment.
